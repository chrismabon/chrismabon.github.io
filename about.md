        <p class="redlist">Hello!</p>
        <p class="blocktext">A developer of apps and websites, I 
            own/admin a personal AWS web server and enjoy tinkering around with 
            various Linux systems. My favorite languages include JavaScript, Python, C/C++, and Java. 
            In terms of databases, I am familiar with PostgreSQL, mySQL, and SQLite.</p>
        <p class="blocktext">My time as a budtender at a busy dispensary has been an 
            explosive learning experience: The need to quickly understand a hefty sum of
            information on the topic of cannabis has elevated my level of understanding
            to "expert". Familiar topics include cannabinoids, terpenes and the ensemble effect,
            medical-use, legalization status, and strain genetics.</p>
        <p class="blocktext">No stranger to vino, I worked in boutique a wine 
            and spirits store for nearly 8 years, acquiring a wealth of knowledge concerning
            the sale, consumption, and preservation of various fine wines and liquors. The
            picture to the left is a shot of myself sampling the bouquet (smell) of one of the wines
            poured at the tasting events I would conduct for the store.</p>
