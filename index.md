>> "I'm personally convinced that computer science has a lot in common with physics. 
>> Both are about how the world works at a rather fundamental level. 
>> The difference, of course, is that while in physics you're supposed to figure out how the world is made up, in computer science you create the world. 
>> Within the confines of the computer, you're the creator. 
>> You get to ultimately control everything that happens..." 
>> -Linus Torvalds
